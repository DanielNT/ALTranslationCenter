This extension allows to improve speed in multilanguage development in AL Language using `developer comments` for adding translations. Previously, the idea was used in AL Language Tools extension (thanks ClipDynamics!).

## Requirements
- AL Language extension.

## Features in preview mode
- (NEW) Supports `multiroot workspaces`.
- Search occurrences in case of badly formatted caption translations (prevents of translation process).
- Edit or add new languages for conversion.

## Main features
- Xliff translation, based in developer comments (property `comment`).
- Publish and package directly with translations, without need to create tasks or do manually.
- Included basic snippets (for `Label`, `Caption`, `OptionCaption`, `Tooltip`, `AboutTitle`, `AboutText` and `AdditionalSearchTerms`).
- Generated files are compatible to use with `MicrosoftÂ© Multilingual Editor`.

## Improvements
- Added directly support for more languages (like Catalan, Galician, Basque, Portuguese, Polish).
- Translation texts can contain '=' character.
- Can translate .xlf files created with extension with invalid filenames characters (like ":").

## Known Issues
- May not work with first versions of AL Language extension.
- You tell me.
