This extension allows to improve speed in multilanguage development in AL Language using `developer comments` for adding translations. Previously, the idea was used in AL Language Tools extension (thanks ClipDynamics!).

## Requirements
- AL Language extension for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.
- Visual Studio Code v1.56.0 (April 2021) or higher.

## Main features
- Xliff translation, based in developer comments (property `comment`).
- Commands for directly packaging/publishing with the updated translation.
- Included basic translation snippets (for `Label`, `Caption`, `OptionCaption`, `Action`, `Tooltip`, `AboutTitle`, `AboutText` and `AdditionalSearchTerms`).
- Generated files are compatible to use with `MicrosoftÂ© Multilingual Editor`.
- Search occurrences in case of badly formatted caption translations (prevents of translation process).
- Supports translation of the AL project in use in `multiroot workspaces`.
- You can customize the integrated language mapping, **adding** new languages or **changing** the XLIFF output language.

- You can map from one abbreviation to multiple languages, separated with `|` character.

## Commands
| Command                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ATC: Generate Xliff translations from source` | This command generates the translations (based in developer comments) for the current `NameOfExtension.g.xlf` at folder `Translations` (the source XLIFF). This file is created after executing `AL: Package` or `AL: Publish`. Because the file is created after the package, you need to recreate the package to add the translations. |
| `ATC: Package with translations`               | Package *directly with translations*, without need to create tasks or do a repacking manually.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `ATC: Publish with translations`               | Generate and publish the package *directly with translations*, without need to create tasks or do manually. You can customize the behavior in settings, and set if you want to publish always with or without debugging without asking.
